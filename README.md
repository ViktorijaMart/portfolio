# My Portfolio

This is a project I created to show my proudest projects to my future employer.

It's inspired by the cyberpunk aesthetic. I made the navigation and logo to look like neon street signs. The main info is displayed as a hologram.

## Details

To create the holographic effect I used [this code](https://codepen.io/johnlouie04/pen/NeJBwO). I just removed the animation as it felt too distracting.

Also, I learned a lot of new info on how to create a responsive design. Before I mainly used fixed sizes and later would change those in media queries. While doing this project I read [this article](https://ishadeed.com/article/responsive-design/) and applied new knowledge:

- I tried out to add clamp() on font-size, logo.
- I understood better how to use flex for responsive design. I applied it to navigation and main content.
